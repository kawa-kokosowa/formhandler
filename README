I've learned what I /really/ want from a web framework: as little work or involvement on my part as possible. So that's what formhandler does.

Get started:
  1. Launch testhttpd.py
  2. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.py in a web browser.
  3. Open test.py in a file editor to see what's going on!

In ONE command you can have a CGI script which will act as the HTML input
form (for sending data to function), and then it will also handle post/get
data--utilized for evaluating form input, and providing HTML output from
the evaluation. All (mostly) auto-magically.
